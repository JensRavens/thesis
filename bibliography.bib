	Abstract = {We describe monocrystalline graphitic films, which are a few atoms thick but are nonetheless stable under ambient conditions, metallic, and of remarkably high quality. The films are found to be a two-dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands, and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 1013 per square centimeter and with room-temperature mobilities of \~{}10,000 square centimeters per volt-second can be induced by applying gate voltage.},

@article{MRS:8968048,
	Abstract = { ABSTRACT We provide a review of the main aspects related to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs), from their origins to the important issue of their practical quantification. The discussion also focuses on correcting some long-held misconceptions regarding the EFs in SERS, which still persist through the literature. We explain the main topics in simple terms, aiming at clarification of basic concepts rather than an in-depth overview of the already existing literature. },
