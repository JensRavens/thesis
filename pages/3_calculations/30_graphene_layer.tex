\section{Calculations for Graphene}
\label{sec:calculations}

The aim of this section is to model a three dimensional layer of graphene as depicted in figure \ref{fig:heeg-experiment} and correlate it with the simulated data from section \ref{sec:simulation}. The geometry of the graphene layer is used to project the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ onto the graphene layer and calculate the local and total enhancement for this layer.

The graphene layer is pulled into the cavity by about \SI{5}{nm} and spans over \SI{150}{nm} until it adheres to the substrate beside the dimer according to ref.~\cite{heeg}. To get a realistic estimation of the location of the graphene layer a 3D modelling software with cloth simulation will be used.

\end{figure}

Using the 3D modelling software Blender 2.7 a simulation of cloth falling on two cylinders was used to approximate the location of the graphene layer. As visible in figure \ref{fig:blender} two cylinders of \SI{45}{nm} height and \SI{50}{nm} radius (gold plus chrome interlayer) were placed on an infinite plane. Next a 1nm thick plane material was placed on top and cloth simulation was enabled for this layer.

After the simulation finished with the cloth like material the results were compared to figure 1c of ref.~\cite{heeg}. This was repeated with tweeked properties of the material until the simulated 3D model matched the estimated position of the graphene layer. Because no material caused the layer to be pulled into the cavity the manual sculpturing tool was used to move the layer down into the cavity. The resulting 3D model is shown in figure \ref{fig:blender}.

To import the simulated structure into Matlab for further calculations an intermediate step was used. A camera was setup in the scene to point down at the structure with a special light source that illuminated the simulated layer according to it's $z$ value. The highest value is represented as white while black represents the base plane. All other values are projected linearly in the gray colorspace, effectively creating the heightmap shown in \ref{fig:blender}.

This heightmap was then imported as a two dimensional matrix of height values:
\begin{minted}{matlab}
  classdef map
     properties
         values
     end
     methods
         function obj = map(name, scale)
            image = double(imread(name));
            if ndims(image) == 3
              image = 0.2989 * image(:,:,1) + 0.5870 * image(:,:,2) +
                0.1140 * image(:,:,3);
            end
            max_value = max(reshape(image, 1, []));
            obj.values = image ./ max_value .* scale;
         end

         function height = height(obj, x, y)
            height = obj.values(x, y);
         end
     end
  end
\end{minted}

This Matlab code imports an image, converts it to grayscale if needed, normalizes the values to be between 0 and 1 and then scales the heightmap with a factor. For a connection to the simulated near-field, the image had to have the same resolution as the simulation (401 datapoints in the $x$- and $y$ axis for this case). The normalization was needed to account for the height map conversion: Within the image data in the portable network graphics format, values were only saved as a range (white = 2, black = 0), therefore skewing the $z$ axis. The height scale factor within the import resolved this problem.

The calculation was using a scale factor of $47$ so that the graphene layer was hovering \SI{2}{nm} above the gold structure. This was done to mitigate the lightning effects at the discretised surface of the nanostructure.
