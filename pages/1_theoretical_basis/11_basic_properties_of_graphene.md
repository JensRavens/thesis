### Basic Properties of Graphene

Graphene is an example of a two dimensional hexagon atom structure (also called honeycomb structure). Although it only has been discovered and researched recently in [2014][props] graphene has sparked increasing interest with scientists due to its extraordinary mechanical, optical and electric properties.

Graphene is a two dimensional allotrope of carbon where atoms are densely packed in a hexagonal pattern with a distance of about 1.42Å. Each sp²-hybridized carbon atom has a covalent $\sigma$-bond to three other carbon atoms.

#### Band Structure and Band Gap

Due to the symmetry of the system the $\pi$ orbitals can be treated independently and as the main contributor to the conduction and valence band. The [dispersion relation is][bands]

$$E(\mathbf{k})=\pm\sqrt{\gamma_0^2\left(1+4\cos^2\frac{k_ya}{2}+4\cos\frac{k_ya}{2}\cdot\cos\frac{k_x\sqrt{3}a}{2}\right)},$$

with the hopping energy $\gamma_0\approx2.8eV$, the lattice constant $a\approx2.46Å$, "$+$" for the conduction band and "$-$" for the valence band.

Plotting the dispersion relation reveals that conduction and valence band touch in the K points and therefore graphene is a semiconductor without a band gap.

#### Other Properties

Other interesting properties of graphene often exceed those of any other material. It has an intrinsic [tensile strength of 130 GPa and a Young's modulus as high as 1TPa][mechanical]. Also it's [impermeable to gases][impermeable] and has a light absorption of exactly [$\pi\alpha$][absorption].
