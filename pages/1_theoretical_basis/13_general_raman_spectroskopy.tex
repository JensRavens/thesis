\subsubsection{Raman Spectroscopy of Graphene}

The Raman spectrum of graphene has three major peaks which are called for historical reasons $D$, $G$ and $2D$ as seen in figure~\ref{fig:dispersion}. While the $D$ peak is activated by defects in the graphene lattice the $G$ and $2D$ peaks are also present in pristine graphene~\cite{Ferrari2013}.

Similar to the electronic band structure of graphene it is also possible to define a phononic band structure as shown in figure~\ref{fig:phonons}. Due to its two-atom unit cell the phonon dispersion relation has three optical (O) and three acoustic branches (A). The phonon modes perpendicular to the plane are called out-of-plane (o) in contrast to in-plane modes (i). For further classification vibrations perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the two atoms in the unit cell are called transverse (T) and longitudinal (L).

The most prominent feature in the Raman spectrum of graphene is the $2D$ peak which is the $D$ peak overtone at $\sim$ \SI{2700}{cm^{-1}}. It is a second-order Raman mode that appears because of a double-resonance process\cite{double-resonance} (see figure~\ref{fig:raman-modes}). Two iTO phonons at the $K$ point with opposite wavevectors are involved in the scattering process to satisfy the momentum conservation as shown in figure~\ref{fig:raman-modes}. This mode does not require a defect for activation and is therefore always visible in graphene's Raman spectrum.

The G peak at \SI{1582}{cm^{-1}} is the only first-order Raman mode of graphene. It belongs to the iLO and iTO phonon branches at the $\Gamma$ point \cite{Ferrari2013}. This corresponds to vibrations of the two sublattices against each other. In group theory it belongs to the two-dimensional $E_{2g}$ representation~\cite{yucordona}.
