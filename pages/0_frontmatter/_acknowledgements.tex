\section*{Acknowledgements}

I want to express my gratitude to all those who provided me with all kinds of
help and support during my work in the last months.

My special thanks go to my supervisor Niclas MÃ¼ller who relentlessly introduced
me to field of solid state physics and plasmonics and helped me setting up the
simulations. His suggestions and proofreading of this work were invaluable. Only
due to his help with words and deeds it was possible for me two write this thesis
while working full time.

Also I would like to thank the working group and of course its head
Prof.~Dr.~Stephanie~Reich for letting we work on this simulation topic.
